               <h1>The Best Cured Meats</h1>
               <p>The most heartwarming protein and fat success stories</p>

            <h3>Prociutto Crudo</h3>
            <img src = "images/prosciutto.jpg"id = "prosciutto"/>
            <p>Prociutto was never cooked as a child, and had a hard time connecting with other meats, whether cooked or uncooked. The ham resented its parents for many years, but after about six months in a popular treatment known as dry-curing therapy, prosciutto crudo has learned to forgive and now gladly lends itself to be sliced delicately thin.</p>
            <h3>Bacon</h3>

            <!-- height = "75" width = "75"  -->
            <p>A favorite in America, bacon had abnormally high salt levels. After working hard to rinse off well, maintain a good diet, and soaking up some feel-good smoke, most professionals would put bacon's salt content in the "ideal" range. You'll find that it is perfect for crisping up in the oven or in a skillet, and that its sodium will make your heart sing.   </p>
            <h3>Salami</h3>
            <img src = "images/salami.jpg"id = "salami"/>
            <p>After being ground up into small pieces, salami had severe PTSD, and a mild case of multiple personality disorder. Fermentation therapy, as well as dry-curing sessions similar to what prosciutto underwent, helped pull the bits of the mentally fragmented pork and beef back together.</p>
            <h3>Smoked Kielbasa</h3>
            <img src = "images/kielbasa.jpg"id = "kielbasa"/>
            <p>This Polish sausage suffered from extreme lethargy, which was found to be caused by a bad bout of scurvy. After being diagnosed, it went through several rounds of smoking. Today this kielbasa can be spotted out and about, maintaining a lively friendship with sauerkraut, with scurvy far in the rearview mirror.</p>

               <h3>Ground Beef</h3>
               <img src = "images/ground_beef.jpg"id = "ground_beef"/>
               <p>Ground beef suffers from dementia. You may see packages of ground beef that have forgotton where they were going and are sadly sitting amongst the raw chicken.</p>
               <h3>Chicken Breast</h3>
               <img src = "images/chicken.jpg"id = "chicken"/>
               <p>Because of the wide-spread affliction of all chickens raised for meat being of the Cobb-500 variety, chicken breast suffers from a complete lack of flavor. The only hope for a cure is to replace all of them with an entirely different species of chicken.</p>
